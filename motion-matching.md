## Motion Matching

* Works with Unreal Engine 5.4.1
  
* Add the Motion Trajectory plugin
* Add the Pose Search plugin
* Restart the engine. It is ok that they might say they are experimental.
* Create a project you want to start building.

* Open Unreal Engine 5.2 or 5.3 and open or create a Lyra project.
* Navigate to Characters > Heroes > Mannequins > Animations > Locomotion > Unarmed (or something)
* Filter on Animation Sequences
* Select all the animation sequences
* Right-click and choose Actions > Migrate
* Select the Content folder of the project you want to migrate the animations into
* Close Unreal 5.2 but do not save it

* Open up your new project in Unreal Engine 5.4 again
* Create a Pose Search Schema
* Choose the SK_Mannequin from Lyra (although it shouldn't matter, it's the same one)
